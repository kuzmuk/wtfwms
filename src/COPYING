WTF with my server (http://wtfwms.com)
==================================

Extraordinary tool for researching web application performance issues.

This is a source code for client that should be installed on servers. It fetches all needed metrics and sends them to [wtfwms.com](http://wtfwms.com) dashboard.

You can find prebuilt binaries for some Centos and Ubuntu distros or build own package for any other linux platform.
